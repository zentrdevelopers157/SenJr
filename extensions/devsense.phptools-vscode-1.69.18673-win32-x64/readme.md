## Code Help and Completion

Take advantage of type-based, blazing-fast code completion, signature help, and colorful tooltips within VS Code. The editor is context-aware, lists available symbols with detailed information, performs type analysis, and completes selected options. It also auto-completes the dollar character for variables and even provides a URL to online documentation when possible.

![Code Completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/completion-tooltip.gif)

The integrated manual of all PHP symbols is localized for the major languages - English, Japanese, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Russian, or Chinese.

![Localized Help](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/tooltip-help-ja.png)

## Code Actions

Quickly refactor and generate code using code actions. This feature gives you quick fixes for the code that is right at your cursor, at your hand. Generate **PHPDoc**, property **getters and setters**, implementation of interfaces, abstracts, and more.

![Generate getters and setters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/getter-setter-action.gif)

## Debug

Run the integrated built-in server, debug a script, or connect to a local or remote server. Debug is provided through _Xdebug_ extension and provides you with all you need. Easy to use with the respect to VS Code conventions. See and manage breakpoints, watch expressions, locals, the call stack, or change a variable's value. Tooltips reveal the expression's value as well, including subsequent listing through large arrays.

## Continuous Code Validation

Reveal troublesome issues and problems without testing, and even before running the code. The built-in type analysis and code validation will check the entire project in seconds, and it gets updated as you type. Problems are listed in the `Problems` window and underlined right in the code editor.

## Navigation

The editor provides you with `Go to definition`, `Find all references`, and browse through all the symbols within the current document and the workspace. It takes advantage of the type analysis and context-aware search, quickly navigating even through extremely large projects.

![Find All References](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/find-all-refs.gif)

## Rename Refactoring

Safely find and rename variables, classes, interfaces, or functions with a single press of a key. The feature takes into account PHPDoc comments, possible indirect variables, or dynamic code constructs.

![Rename Variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/rename-variable.gif)

## Code Formatting

The integrated _formatter_ helps you keep the code looking clean and maintain the selected code style (e.g. `"PSR-12"`).

![Format Document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/format-document.gif)

You can either format the whole document, selected text, or it can be triggered based on user actions, such as typing, saving or pasting.

HTML, CSS and Javascript sections in the PHP files get formatted according to your VS Code settings.

## Testing

PHPUnit, Paratest, and Pest tests within the project are detected and automatically listed in the Test Exporer view. You can run and debug all the tests, a suite, a single test, or a dataset. All the listed tests are marked with the succeeded icon with details of the test run. Failures are inlined in the code with the corresponding diff. See the [testing documentation](https://docs.devsense.com/vscode/test-explorer) for more details.

![Test View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/test-explorer.gif)

## PHP Doc Comments

_Documentary Comments_ are generated upon typing `/**` above functions, classes, properties, constants, variables, and namespaces. The editor provides full code completion, tooltips, highlighting, searching references, and refactoring through PHPDoc.

Optionally, snippets can be customized using settings `php.docblock.***Snippet`, taking advantage of [variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables), i.e.:

```json
"php.docblock.classSnippet": {
    "@author": "John",
    "@copyright": "(c) $CURRENT_YEAR"
}
```

![phpdoc generate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DEVSENSE/phptools-docs/master/docs/vscode/imgs/phpdoc-generate.gif)

_This feature requires `"editor.formatOnType": true` setting to be enabled._
